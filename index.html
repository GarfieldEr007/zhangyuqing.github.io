<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h1>

<p>As a doctoral student at Boston University, my interest lies in applying statistical and computational approaches in biological problems. Formerly trained at School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University in the area of applied math, I am currently searching for a balance between the abstract beauty of theoretical math and concrete practical applications which serves for the benefit of a large population.</p>

<p>The circadian clock is a major regulator of gene expression in many organisms, and is able to drive important metabolic functions in response to cyclical environmental factors. Neurospora crassa has long served as a model organism to study the circadian clock, given that a high proportion of its genes are under circadian control and that phenotypic changes in response to the clock are easily observed. While the effects of circadian-controlled gene expression have been widely explored, the mechanisms behind such processes are only beginning to be understood. A more thorough understanding of these underlying mechanisms is urgently motivated by the high prevalence of metabolic disease in adults, a phenomenon largely attributed to modern disruptions in human circadian rhythms. The goal of this project is to build a computational model of the N. crassa clock controlled regulatory network, which will be used to decipher mechanisms under the circadian regulatory network, and predict the effect of manipulation in the network on the metabolism of the organism.</p>

<a id="reference-batch-combat" class="anchor" href="#reference-batch-combat" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reference batch ComBat</h2>

<p>Batch effect refers to non-biological variations in gene expression of samples generated under different conditions in microarray experiments. The existence of batch effect jeopardizes comparability of samples in different batches, causes difficulty in combining data from multiple batches for further analysis. Many methods have been used to adjust batch effect. ComBat uses empirical Bayes method on an L/S model that effectively adjusts the batch effect, and remains robust to outliers and small size batches. This project intends to develop a tool based on ComBat that deals with such an issue, when we want to reserve information from one specific batch, and let all the other batches resemble it. This batch is referred to as the “reference batch”.</p>

<p>Previous study has shown decline in prediction accuracy of prognostic algorithms used across studies, which is regarded as an obstacle of implementing academically developed models in clinical use. We addressed three sources of heterogeneity between data sets than might account for the influence, including covariate shift, gene expression covariance and true simulation model. We designed methods to test each hypothesis.</p>

<p>With microarray sample of children with NSID, a type of mental retardation, we detected the genetic variants and focused on pathways under different levels of FDR control. We validated our result using published related genes to prove the efficiency of micro-array data in detecting CNVs, and summarized new findings. We also inspected hot spots in the samples, which could lead to potential clinical use.</p>

<p>We used HMM-based CNVhac software to detect genes related to Chinese and Western therapies.
Gene Ontology and Pathway Analysis were performed and the variant regions were visualized. To combine information of CNV and SNP, we used a lasso-logistic regression model as a classifier of genes.</p>

<p>The bulk of my life is devoted to the PhD grind, and will devote to my career in the future according to my plan. When time allows, I prefer some quality time at home, with a nice cup of hot tea, a good book or a great movie. </p>

<p>I enjoy a bit of difference and challenge in my mostly repeating daily routine. And if given the choice, I would always go for the hard mode. </p>

<p>My family and friends are the harbor when I'm tired from sailing in the rough sea. I am grateful for the support from my parents, who's always looked out for me, and my boyfriend <a href="http://ronghanghu.com/">Ronghang</a>, who shed the light in my life and lit up the path ahead.</p>
